These unique carrots have a sweet, slightly peppery flavor that sets them apart from their orange counterparts. Originating from ancient varieties, they are cultivated to preserve their genetic diversity and nutritional value. By choosing these carrots, you support farming practices that prioritize soil health and biodiversity. Their deep purple hue, attributed to anthocyanins, provides antioxidants not commonly found in regular carrots. Perfect for roasting, juicing, or as a raw snack, Heirloom Purple Carrots bring a splash of color and a host of nutrients to your plate.",
