Made from the milk of grass-fed cows that roam freely on organic pastures, this cheese is a testament to the quality and integrity of our ingredients. Each batch is aged in our on-site cellars, where time and nature work together to develop the cheese`s unique flavor and texture. The result is a cheese that is not only delicious but also rich in nutrients, including calcium and protein. We take pride in our sustainable and ethical farming practices, ensuring that each slice of cheese supports the health of our planet and the welfare of our animals.",
