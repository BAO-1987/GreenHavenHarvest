Our commitment to ethical farming practices means these cattle are raised without the use of antibiotics or growth hormones, ensuring the beef you enjoy is not only delicious butalso naturally healthier. The  grass-fed diet contributes to a leaner meat, higher in omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants such as vitamin E, compared to conventional beef. We work closely with local farmers who share our values of sustainability and animal welfare, guaranteeing traceability and transparency from pasture to plate. Our beef is hand-selected and aged to perfection, offering a depth of flavor that is both rich and satisfying.",
