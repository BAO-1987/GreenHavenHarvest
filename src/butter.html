Made exclusively from the cream of cows that graze on organic pastures, our butter has a natural golden hue, indicative of the high beta-carotene content in their diet. These cows are raised without the use of synthetic hormones or antibiotics, ensuring that every pat of butter is as wholesome as it is delicious. The butter is churned to perfection, achieving a creamy consistency that melts beautifully into your favorite dishes. Whether you`re baking, frying, or spreading, our Organic Butter adds a touch of gourmet to any meal.",
