Our ducks are raised in a natural habitat, with plenty of space to roam, forage, and live as they instinctively should, which not only ensures their welfare but also significantly enhances the flavor and nutritional value of the meat. They feed on a varied diet that includes insects, grasses, and grains, without the use of antibiotics or growth hormones. This natural lifestyle results in duck meat that is not only more flavorful but also contains a healthier balance of fats, including a higher proportion of omega-3 fatty acids. Our commitment to ethical and sustainable farming practices means that when you choose our Pasture-Raised Duck, you`re choosing a product that`s good for both you and the environment.",
